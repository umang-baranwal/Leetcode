Given an array arr[] of length N, find the length of the longest sub-array with a sum equal to 0.


Input: arr[] = {15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23}
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest sub-array with elements summing up-to 0 is {-2, 2, -8, 1, 7}

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray with 0 sum

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000, for each valid i
